# TryJulia

This repo aims to help people that want to get started with Julia. More than a list of reaons [why you should try Julia](https://github.com/Datseris/whyjulia-manifesto), this is supposed to be a list of useful resources to help people that want to get started but don't know where/how.  

## Learn more
- [Noteworthy Differences from other Languages](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/) - Good resource if you are coming to Julia from MATLAB, R, Python, C/C++ or Common LISP
- [Julia Learning](https://julialang.org/learning/) - Julia learning hub
  - [Julia Books](https://julialang.org/learning/books/) - Nice list of Julia related books (some available online)

## Relevant links
- [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) - Julia version manager. Compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS

### Packages
- [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) - Reactive Notebook env for the Julia Language

### My stack [TO DO]
- [DataFrames.jl]() - Similar do Python's Pandas, allows you work with DataFrames (obviously)
- [Infiltrator.jl]() - For debugging
- [Makie.jl]() - For plotting (it's my favorite plot package for it's flexibility)
- [Revise.jl]() - So you can iteractively change the code and the live results when developing a package

#### Calling other languages code from within Julia
- [PythonCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl) - Calling Python code from Julia
- [RCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl) - Calling R code from Julia
- [MATLAB.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl) - Calling MATLAB code from Julia (doesn't work with all MATLAB versions)
- [MAT.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/MAT.jl) - Read `.mat` files from Julia
